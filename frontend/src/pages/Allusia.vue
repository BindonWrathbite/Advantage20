      The modern world of Allusia was born from the original, singular continent of Talanari. After the 2nd sundering,
      brought forth by the great crash and defeat of the God Drake: Drathgorog, Talanari began to rumble and spread
      rapidly into 4 separate continents and a rumored set of islands. These continents and islands would be named by
      the heartiest and most ancient of races: the dwarves and elves. The continents would soon be named: Sha’harragh,
      Wildengraad, Elishkäva, Kor’amon and Drathgorog Isles. As time ticks on, Allusia would find itself inhabited by
      numerous creatures, races, and natural structures such as forests, mountains, and many more. The intelligent races
      would form cities, villages, towns, and various groups of like-minded individuals. The creatures would roam wild
      in packs or as lone wolves, hoping to pick off smaller prey. With the recent developments of Allusia, there are
      many experiences and adventures to be had. Are you willing to take up the reigns and find your place in this
      world? If so, its future may lie in your hands. Happy Adventuring!
